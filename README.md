# js_promises  

source:  https://github.com/StephenGrider/MongoCasts

two files.  Purpose is to show the difference between simple Javascript (ES6) code, and one with PROMISES

game = simple

open in browser... if you click button more than 5 times, you win!  Else, you lose (try again!)

both game.html and game_w_promises.html should work the same from users perspective, but the code works differently
